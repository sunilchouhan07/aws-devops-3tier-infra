# 🚀 AWS 3-Tier Infrastructure with Terraform

Production-ready **AWS 3-Tier Infrastructure** built with **Terraform**.

This repository provisions the complete infrastructure required to host scalable web applications on AWS. It follows Infrastructure as Code (IaC) best practices and prepares EC2 instances for automated deployments.

> **Note**
>
> This repository provisions infrastructure only.
>
> Application deployment is handled separately by:

# Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](docs/architecture/architecture.png)

## Infrastructure Components

- Amazon VPC
- Public & Private Subnets (2 AZ)
- Internet Gateway
- NAT Gateway
- Route Tables
- Application Load Balancer
- Auto Scaling Group
- Launch Template
- EC2 Instances
- IAM Roles
- Security Groups
- Amazon RDS PostgreSQL
- Amazon S3
- DynamoDB
- AWS Systems Manager (SSM)

---

# Repository Purpose

This repository is responsible for:

- Provisioning AWS Infrastructure
- Creating networking resources
- Creating EC2 Auto Scaling Groups
- Creating Application Load Balancer
- Creating PostgreSQL Database
- Creating IAM Roles
- Creating S3 backend
- Creating DynamoDB locking table
- Bootstrapping EC2 instances
- Preparing servers for application deployments

This repository **does not deploy application code.**

---

# EC2 Bootstrap

EC2 instances are automatically configured using **Terraform User Data**.

During instance launch the bootstrap script installs and configures:

- AWS CLI v2
- Node.js
- PM2
- Nginx
- Amazon SSM Agent
- Deployment directories
- Backend environment file
- Reverse proxy configuration

After provisioning every EC2 instance is immediately ready to receive deployments through AWS Systems Manager.
